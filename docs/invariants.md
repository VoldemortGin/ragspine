# Invariants (code-enforced)

Authoritative detail for the invariants summarized in the root `CLAUDE.md`. Each
entry should name: what it guarantees · where it is enforced · the test that
freezes it.

## Anti-fabrication

<!-- TODO: where the rewrite happens (src/ragspine/agent/agent.py) and the regression test. -->

## Provenance

<!-- TODO: source_doc_id + locator carried end to end; where lineage could be dropped. -->

## RESTRICTED isolation (two exits)

**Guarantees** `sensitivity == RESTRICTED` content never reaches an LLM prompt or an answer.
**Enforced** at two exits before any prompt: `retrieval/link/narrative_link.py` (the snippet
adapter drops RESTRICTED chunks) and `retrieval/rerank/listwise_rerank.py` (RESTRICTED text never
enters the listwise judge prompt). Both must stay; neither is sufficient alone.

**At-rest (third, persistence layer).** Persisting a chunk's embedding writes a *recoverable
derivative* of its text next to its lineage (`doc_id`, `source_locator`) — a surface that bypasses
both exits. The swappable `PersistencePolicy`
(`src/ragspine/retrieval/vector/persistence_policy.py`) gates this: the default `IsolationFirstPolicy`
**never persists a RESTRICTED chunk's vector at rest** (it still retrieves via BM25 with vector
score 0, then is stripped at the two exits). `PersistEverythingPolicy` is opt-in and **only**
appropriate when the entire vector store is itself classified RESTRICTED-tier at rest — encrypted
volume, access-controlled, and excluded from routine backups. The `where`-filter pushdown in
`VectorStore` (`retrieval/vector/store.py`) is an additional optional enforcement point at the store.

**Frozen by** `tests/retrieval/lexical/test_persistence_ingest.py` (default policy persists zero
RESTRICTED vectors; opt-in persists them) and the existing two-exit tests under
`tests/retrieval/link/` and `tests/retrieval/rerank/`.

## Privacy-aware traces

<!-- TODO: common/observability records codes / counts / timings only. -->

# VectorStore seam — the pluggable vector index, and how it wires into retrieval

Deep dive behind [`docs/prd-vector-store-seam.md`](../../../../docs/prd-vector-store-seam.md).
The PRD is the originating spec; this is the live contract. Two halves:

1. **The seam** (`vector/store.py`) — a `Protocol` + a zero-dependency offline default, with the
   three invariants (provenance / isolation / determinism) bound by `tests/conformance/`.
2. **The wiring** (`lexical/retrieval.py`) — `HybridRetriever` delegates its vector **scoring** to
   that seam instead of an inline cosine loop, so a real Qdrant / pgvector / sqlite-vec backend can
   be dropped in by config without touching the retriever.

## The seam

`VectorStore` owns exactly one concern: **store vectors + answer one filtered top-k similarity
query.** It does *not* own BM25, RRF fusion, or rerank — those stay in `HybridRetriever`.

```python
class VectorStore(Protocol):
    def upsert(self, records: Sequence[VectorRecord]) -> int: ...
    def query(self, vector, *, k=DEFAULT_QUERY_K, where=None) -> list[VectorHit]: ...
    def delete(self, *, where: Mapping[str, str]) -> int: ...
    def count(self) -> int: ...
```

`InProcessVectorStore` is the default: brute-force cosine + `id`-ascending tie-break, byte-for-byte
equivalent to the cosine loop the retriever used before wiring. `cosine` matches
`retrieval.cosine_similarity` exactly (zero vector → `0.0`). One shared dimension; a mixed-dimension
upsert or a wrong-dimension query raises `ValueError` — never a silently bad vector.

`make_vector_store(spec)` is the config-string factory (mirrors `make_embedding_backend`):
`none` → `None` (retriever self-builds the in-process default), `in_process` →
`InProcessVectorStore`, anything else → `ValueError` pointing at the future `[vector]` extra. Env
override: `RAGSPINE_VECTOR_STORE`. Selectable end-to-end via `ServiceConfig.vector_store`.

## The wiring (byte-identical by construction)

`HybridRetriever.__init__` resolves `self.vector_store`: when an `embedding_backend` is present it
uses the injected store or builds an `InProcessVectorStore`; pure-BM25 leaves it `None`. In
`search`, the inline `cosine_similarity` loop is replaced by:

1. embed **missing candidate texts only** into `_embedding_cache` (the prefilter-before-scoring
   invariant is preserved — a filtered-out chunk's text never reaches `embed_texts`);
2. `upsert` the candidate vectors as `VectorRecord`s (metadata = the 5 recall dims, str-coerced);
3. per query variant, `vector_store.query(query_vec, k=len(candidates), where=...)` for the vector
   ranking and per-candidate score.

Equivalence rests on four facts, all conformance-bound: the store sorts by `(-score, id)`
identically to the old loop; `k=len(candidates)` returns **every** candidate including zero-cosine
ones (so `best_vector` is populated for all, exactly as the inline `zip(sims, candidates)` did);
`where` replicates the Python prefilter exactly (a dim is a filter **iff its value is not None**, so
`""` is a real filter value, never omitted); and a `h.id in by_id` guard keeps results scoped to the
current candidates even against a shared/superset store. A regression golden
(`tests/retrieval/lexical/test_retrieval_vector_store.py::test_byte_identity_golden`) pins the exact
`(bm25, vector, fused)` triples captured from the pre-wiring implementation.

**Precondition:** candidate `chunk_id`s are unique (the existing `by_id = {c.chunk_id: c}` already
assumes this). Duplicate ids are out of the supported input space.

### Lifecycle / invalidation

`NarrativeIndex` owns one `vector_store` and populates it **at ingest** (see "Persistence" below) —
there is no separate `_embedding_cache`; the store *is* the durable vector source. Each `ingest`
re-ingests a doc with an **unconditional, doc-scoped** `delete(where={"doc_id": d})` *before* the
(policy-gated) re-upsert of the new version's vectors. That unconditional delete is the load-bearing
correctness property: it sweeps every old `chunk_id` of doc *d* (regardless of seq drift, shrinking
chunk count, or a same-`chunk_id`-new-text rewrite), so no stale or now-RESTRICTED vector can survive
a re-ingest. Other docs' vectors are untouched.

## Isolation: `where` is a third pushdown point, not a RESTRICTED exit

The `where` filter the retriever passes carries only the **5 recall dims**, never `sensitivity`.
RESTRICTED content still rides through the retriever and is stripped at the two authoritative exits
(`retrieval/link`, `retrieval/rerank`) — wiring the store changed nothing here. The store's filter
pushdown is an *optional* third enforcement point (proven by the conformance isolation test: a
RESTRICTED record is excluded by `where={"sensitivity": "INTERNAL"}` even when it is the exact
nearest neighbor, and — honest negative control — is *present* without the filter). The retriever
does not use it for RESTRICTED; the capability simply exists for a backend that wants store-level
enforcement.

## Topology

`HybridRetriever.topology()` names the resolved store: the `vector` node's label becomes
`向量通道 · <StoreClass>` and its `symbol` is the store class's dotted path (drift-guard-resolvable).
So the diagram tells the truth about *which* vector backend this pipeline assembled.

## Adapter #1: sqlite-vec (`vector/adapters/sqlite_vec.py`)

The first real backend, behind the `[vector]` extra (lazy-imported; the core still runs on the
in-process default with zero deps). It stores vectors in a **sqlite-vec `vec0` virtual table**
(`id TEXT PK, embedding float[N] distance_metric=cosine, +meta TEXT`), default `:memory:`, optional
`db_path` for **durable persistence across process restarts** — the thing the in-process default
can't do.

It passes the **entire** conformance kit (66 cases) by registering one line in the conftest, which
is the whole point of the seam: an adapter that broke provenance / isolation / determinism would go
red here, not in production. It clears the kit because it reuses `store._cosine` and `store._matches`
directly — so scoring, the exact-`0.0` zero-vector rule, the id-ascending tie-break, and the
"absent key excludes" `where` semantics are **identical** to the in-process default, not
re-implemented.

Two deliberate, documented choices:
- **Scoring is a full-scan + Python cosine**, not vec0's native KNN `MATCH`. vec0's `k` is capped at
  4096 and it returns a `NULL` distance for zero vectors; a full scan sidesteps both and keeps the
  scoring byte-aligned with the default (so **no conformance "exact vs approximate" capability flag
  is needed** — it's an exact, deterministic store). Native-KNN acceleration with exact float64
  re-rank is a scale-time optimization, out of scope for the first adapter.
- **`upsert` is DELETE-then-INSERT** (vec0 rejects `INSERT OR REPLACE`), preserving id-replace
  semantics. Re-open recovers the dimension from a stored vector, or from the `float[N]` schema when
  the table is empty.

Selectable by config: `make_vector_store("sqlite_vec")` / `RAGSPINE_VECTOR_STORE=sqlite_vec`, and it
flows through `build_narrative_retriever` / `ServiceConfig` exactly like the default. `.topology()`
names it (`向量通道 · SqliteVecVectorStore`).

## Persistence, made real — and sensitivity-gated (`persistence_policy.py`)

Persistence is not a new `ChunkStore` column; it's the **`VectorStore` seam doing its job** (point a
`SqliteVecVectorStore` at a `db_path`). For that persistence to actually pay off, `NarrativeIndex`
changed in three ways:

- **Embed-and-persist at ingest.** When an embedding backend is present, `ingest` embeds the doc's
  chunks and `upsert`s their vectors into the store *then* — not lazily at query. So the durable
  store holds the vectors before any query runs.
- **`doc_id`-scoped invalidation.** Re-ingesting doc *d* does `delete(where={"doc_id": d})` (not the
  old `delete(where={})` blast-all), so other docs' persisted vectors survive across ingests. This is
  why `_record_metadata` now carries `doc_id` (it is *not* part of the retrieval `where`, so scoring
  stays byte-identical).
- **Store-managed retrieve.** `NarrativeIndex` builds its `HybridRetriever` with
  `manage_vectors=False`: the retriever embeds only the *query* and calls `store.query`, never
  re-embedding chunks. So a fresh process over the same `db_path` retrieves with **zero chunk
  re-embedding** — the persistence pays off. (The direct `HybridRetriever` path keeps
  `manage_vectors=True` and stays byte-identical.)

The **`PersistencePolicy` seam** (one method, `persistable(chunk) -> bool`) gates *what* is written at
rest — a minimal, swappable Protocol, deliberately one-decision to avoid a framework-style
god-interface:

- **`IsolationFirstPolicy` (default)** — never persists a `RESTRICTED` chunk's vector. A persisted
  embedding is a recoverable derivative of the chunk text stored next to its lineage; persisting a
  RESTRICTED one would be a new at-rest surface bypassing the two isolation exits. So by default it
  simply isn't written — a RESTRICTED chunk still retrieves via BM25 (vector score 0) and is stripped
  at the `link`/`rerank` exits as before. A NarrativeIndex test binds this: with the default policy, a
  RESTRICTED doc contributes **zero** records to the store.
- **`PersistEverythingPolicy` (opt-in)** — persists all, *only* when the whole vector db is itself
  classified RESTRICTED-tier at rest (see `docs/invariants.md`).

Selectable by config: `make_persistence_policy("default" | "persist_everything")` /
`RAGSPINE_PERSISTENCE_POLICY`, threaded through `build_narrative_retriever` / `ServiceConfig`.

# service — agent contract

Auto-loaded when working under `src/ragspine/service/`. Keep terse; deep dives go in
`src/ragspine/service/docs/`.

## What lives here

`ServiceConfig` (env `RAGSPINE_*`), FastAPI app (app factory + dependency
injection), RQ task queue (`FakeQueue` tests / `RQQueue` prod), ingestion jobs
(worker-owned stores), FAQ short-circuit cache.

## Invariants

- **FAQ conservative exclusions** — structured-numeric / competitor / real-time /
  expired / disabled / RESTRICTED content must never short-circuit. The FAQ layer
  sits in front of the anti-fabrication guard, so a wrong short-circuit bypasses it.
